# drupal_shanti_views_image_grid

A custom views plugin to provide a views layout format for image files, based on the original Shanti Images gallery, 
namely a responsive, Google-like gallery with dropdown down details and a lightbox slideshow. 
This gallery was originally built into the Sarvaka Image subtheme for the Shanti Images site.
It has been extracted and created into a Views Plugin based on the example provided 
by views_elastic_grid, https://www.drupal.org/project/views_elastic_grid so that it could be used with any image file view.

# Libraries used:

* photoswipe,
* row-grid
* jquery.actual
